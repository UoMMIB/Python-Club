- Python club tutorials are orientated towards scientific data analysis & eperiment design
- Python club tutorials are interactive 
- Python club is free for everyone
- Python clib isn't a cult 🤫

# Tutorials
## [Basic bits python](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/BasicBitsPython.ipynb) 
One of the first ever 👶 covers the very basics, including an exercise on DNA translation with ```dictionaries```

## [Back to basics](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/BackToBasics.ipynb)
7 part series on some useful basics in python/jupyter, based around the DNA sequence we translated in [Basic bits python](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/BasicBitsPython.ipynb). Includes:
- ```string ``` parsing - quick tricks with copy + pasted tables; 
- ```bash``` commands in the jupyter notebook; opening & closing files; manually parsing a ```.pdb``` file containing the 3D structure of a protein using the context manager and the ```filter``` function
- ```pandas``` 🐼 for tabular data analysis 
- distance in 3D space and touching on computational complexity; shortcuts with the ```KD-Tree``` algorithm (```scipy``` implementation)
- sparse matrices and graphs - representiong the protein structure as a graph; finding atomic neighborhoods
- objects 📦 - custom objects with ```class``` ; saving attributes with ```__init__``` and ```self``` ; inheritace
