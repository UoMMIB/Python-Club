This is the repository for MIB Python club!

### 🚧🚧 Early construction 🚧🚧

# We have:
### Tutorials:
* **[Some basic python bits](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/BasicBitsPython.ipynb)**  -Introduction to jupyter notebooks and some basic syntax. Use what we've learned to make a DNA translator.
* **[Simple Data Handling](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToDataWranglingWithPandas.ipynb)** - Download live COVID-19 infection rate data and learn to handle ```csv``` files, and make simple plots.
* **[Basic Cheminformatics](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToCheminformatics.ipynb)** - Use the PubChem API to find drug candidates currently in clinical trails for COVID-19 treatment. Find and plot their physical properties. Visualise a PDB structure in the notebook. Introduction to the ```rdkit``` cheminformatics module.
* **Basic Machine leanring** - Download a drug screening dataset for SARS-CoV1 Papain-Like protease, and make a very simple activity predictive model. Then apply the model to the Broad Drug Reporposing Library to Identify potential theraputics.

### Resources
I've dumped some useful resources into [**this file**](https://github.com/UoMMIB/Python-Club/blob/master/Resoruces/resources.md) for topics including, but not limited to:
* Links to Tutorials
* Videos
* Cheat sheets
* Curated lists of machine learning + biology papers
